# About:
This repository contains two assignment submissions for the course Data Mining Techniques (2020) given at the VU, Amsterdam.

## Assignment 1:
We completed a number of Data Mining analyses for various smaller datasets including: a own data initiative (ODI) dataset created from data students of the course submitted, the Fisher Iris dataset, an text-message dataset for spam inference, and the Titanic Kaggle dataset.
## Assignment 2:
We completed a bigger Data Mining project by participating in a Kaggle competition organized specifically for the course. For the competition we had to develop a ranking model, for ranking hotel queries (recommending hotels). The competition was inspired by Kaggle's 2013 Expedia Hotel Recommendations competition.
